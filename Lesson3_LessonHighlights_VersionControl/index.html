            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS, Version Control System is a method of software that allows for a system to 
            record changes to a file or files over a set of time- that way simultaneous changes to a document 
            or set of documents won’t cause a collision of data when saved to the same data server. A single server 
            containing all the versioned files, and a number of clients pull these files for editing and use, be it for 
            corporate business, personal business, or home user situations. The methodic set up of this allows for quicker 
            and easier access to files, but along with these upsides comes a steep downside; due to its centralized administrative 
            control of one unit, it’s a single point of control is also its own failure domain- when it goes down there is no way 
            of transferring information anymore.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Embracing the Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Similar to an SDN controller (software-defined networking), the VCS manages the flow of the network
            to an intelligible level where open flow control to the server is permitted, and the secondary levels of packet distribution
            (a packet is a container with requested information, protected in an “envelope”).  The VCS, is the core of the centralized point
            of distribution to all who connect to that network- hence it lies as the core of the network and any communications between applications
            and the end user devices will be handled via the server device protocols for optimal network path progression. Vendors of the VCS and its 
            controllers include the switches, multilayer 3 switches, routers, and management of the control plane off/on the network hardware.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Focal Point of Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Ensuring that the focal point of control for the network has more than one method 
            of distributing information over the local/remote network is imperative. In regards to failure domains 
            which, when trunking (administrative control enabled on a virtual or physical link) occurs on the switches 
            associated with this, full site outrages occur when a broadcast storm happens over the network 
            (flooding of packets out each port of every available device trying to locate a device that is not on the network, versus sending just one packet). 
            With fate sharing, and failure domains, the domain is bound to a system where failure has little to no impact on its services but what relays the services will suffer; i.e. an
            example of this from a site story of etheralmind is a car tire coming off, bearing fruit to an inevitable car crash and possibly causing more than cars on the freeway to crash as a direct result of that one failure.</p>

            <p class="lead">As stated in the title, the end user is in a location residing far from the locality of the server and its resources as 
            opposed to those closer to it; hence a possible latency in performance from time to time. “The repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple 
            team members (as quoted from the noted internet pdf of lesson 3 notes.” Under all circumstances a protocol of security must be enabled, regardless of whether it is local or remote
            such as ssh (secure socket host). SSH uses an RSA public key (RSA is a form of cryptography that basically prompts the user for a security key or phrase during the transfer of information).</p>

            <p class="lead">Two ways to create a repository, and yet the end result is a clone of an existing remote repository onto the 
            local machine- that is, the transferring of a remote file from a site where ISP’s transfer s requested. Anyone that requests 
            information from the server remotely allows the client to monitor the progress that could allow for either allowable or 
            disprovable clients, and so the development tools created by hosting companies makes it easier to track this progress on its 
            local machines and  private server to present services to its hosts.  If editing of files has been altered locally then the 
            changes will immediately be saved to the server. </p>
